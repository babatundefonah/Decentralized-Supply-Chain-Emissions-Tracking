# Decentralized Supply Chain Emissions Tracking

A blockchain-based solution for transparent, verifiable carbon emissions tracking across complex supply chains.

## Overview

This system enables organizations to track, calculate, and report carbon emissions throughout their supply chain with immutable records and verifiable accuracy. Built on blockchain technology, it provides a decentralized approach to emissions accounting that enhances trust and transparency among all stakeholders.

## Key Components

### Entity Verification Contract

The Entity Verification Contract serves as the gatekeeper for the system, ensuring that only legitimate supply chain participants can interact with the network.

- **Participant Authentication**: Validates the identity of all supply chain entities
- **Role Assignment**: Designates appropriate access levels and permissions
- **Credential Management**: Handles digital credentials and certificates
- **Governance Participation**: Defines voting rights for protocol updates

### Activity Tracking Contract

This contract records all operational activities that generate emissions throughout the supply chain.

- **Event Logging**: Captures emissions-generating activities with timestamps
- **Raw Data Collection**: Records energy usage, material flows, and transport data
- **Activity Classification**: Categorizes activities by emission scope and type
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures immutable activity records with cryptographic proofs

### Calculation Contract

The Calculation Contract converts raw activity data into standardized carbon emissions measurements.

- **Emissions Factor Application**: Applies appropriate emissions factors to activities
- **Methodology Enforcement**: Ensures calculations follow approved protocols (GHG Protocol, ISO 14064, etc.)
- **Uncertainty Handling**: Manages data quality and confidence intervals
- **Version Control**: Maintains calculation methodology history for auditability

### Allocation Contract

This contract distributes emissions responsibility across the supply chain according to defined allocation rules.

- **Attribution Rules**: Implements agreed-upon methods for emissions allocation
- **Boundary Setting**: Defines organizational and operational boundaries
- **Double-Counting Prevention**: Ensures emissions are not counted multiple times
- **Dynamic Reallocation**: Adjusts allocations when supply chain relationships change

### Reporting Contract

The Reporting Contract generates verified emissions disclosures for stakeholders, regulators, and public consumption.

- **Report Generation**: Creates standardized emissions reports by time period and scope
- **Verification Status**: Tracks third-party verification of emissions data
- **Disclosure Controls**: Manages public vs. private reporting permissions
- **Compliance Mapping**: Aligns reports with regulatory requirements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum-compatible blockchain environment
- Web3 provider
- Node.js v16+
- Solidity compiler v0.8.0+

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/decentral-emissions-tracking.git

# Install dependencies
cd decentral-emissions-tracking
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to test network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <test-network>

# Deploy to production
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <main-network>
```

## Usage

### Entity Registration

```javascript
// Register a new supply chain entity
await entityVerificationContract.registerEntity(
  entityAddress,
  entityName,
  entityType,
  verificationDocuments
);

// Verify an entity (by authorized verifier)
await entityVerificationContract.verifyEntity(
  entityAddress,
  verificationStatus
);
```

### Recording Activities

```javascript
// Log an emissions-generating activity
await activityTrackingContract.recordActivity(
  activityType,
  timestamp,
  location,
  quantity,
  units,
  additionalData
);
```

### Calculating Emissions

```javascript
// Calculate emissions for an activity
const emissionsAmount = await calculationContract.calculateEmissions(
  activityId,
  emissionsFactorId
);
```

### Allocating Emissions

```javascript
// Allocate emissions across supply chain entities
await allocationContract.allocateEmissions(
  emissionsId,
  allocationMethod,
  recipientAddresses,
  percentages
);
```

### Generating Reports

```javascript
// Generate an emissions report for a specific period
const report = await reportingContract.generateReport(
  entityAddress,
  startDate,
  endDate,
  emissionScope
);
```

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: Consider implementing zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive data
- **Access Controls**: Ensure proper permission management for contract interactions
- **Oracle Security**: Validate external data sources providing emissions factors
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular security audits are recommended
- **Key Management**: Implement robust key management for entity identities

## Governance

The protocol is governed by verified participants through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure. Participants can propose and vote on:

- Protocol upgrades
- Methodology changes
- Verification standards
- Emissions factor updates
